EUROPEAN UNION (EU)
- 1992-2010
- website (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/fisheries/data/database)
- used "All presentation forms" as presentation form since the "price quoted is first sale of PRODUCT" (any product)
- used "human consumption" as destination, all other forms will be integrated into reduction database
- used "total" for native vessel as we know all landings are in a country regardless of vessel's flag (see below)
- all countries in separate excel files. need to compile data!
- local currency

- Landings data relate to fishery products (product weight and value) landed in a country regardless of the 
nationality of the vessel making the landings, but also to fishery products landed by the country’s vessels 
in non-EU ports and then imported into the EU.  
- because of this ^^, we should use the "Landed Country" as for price estimation it is landed in that country

- Landings def'n (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Fishery_statistics_in_detail#Landings)
- (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/fish_ld_esms.htm)
- "The price quoted is that at the time of the first sale of the product. For products which are not 
immediately sold or which are subject to a contract or other arrangement, the average price has been 
estmated by the national authorities using a method appropriate for that particular situation."
- excluded Croatia because it only had data after 2011
- downloaded price/value data for products with a "destination" other than "human consumption" (ie. reduction)
